This project is a minimal / concise solution of Object oriented programming and design of a PArking Garage that is multi-level and has Large, Compact size parking spots. They allow Motorcycles, Cars and Vans to park. 
Vans must park in 5 consecutive parking spots. Cars are allowed to park in Large and Compact spots. Motorcycles must park ONLY in compact spots. 

Parking spots status is set to VACANT / OCCUPIED if there is no vehicle / vehicle parked. 

This solution implements OOP principles like - Abstraction, Inheritance (vehicle base class) and child classes , Polymorphism( method overriding) and Encapsulation with different access modifiers.
